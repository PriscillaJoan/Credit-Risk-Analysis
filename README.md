# Credit-Risk-Analysis
This aim of this project is to identify  patterns in loan repayment behavior to help predict late payments, preferred payment methods, and other factors that influence repayment consistency. By analyzing these patterns, the goal is to improve risk assessment, tailor repayment solutions, and ultimately reduce loan default rates.
